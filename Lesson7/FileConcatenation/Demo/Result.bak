This is a test demo.  
Tying to merge some .txt files into one .txt file.
 I have a list of files in a text file. 
 I want to merge all the files in the list into one file. I have tried the following code but it does not work. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
